My plans going forward are to continue adding text and content to the main page. The four columns are intended to sroll down. The first box will be a "about us" tab. The second will be about how the user can support the cause. The third will be how to be involved with our club directly, including links to our socials and email list. And the fourth, maybe upcoming events, or maybe a donations total. I'm not sure yet, but I like how the site is shaping up.
